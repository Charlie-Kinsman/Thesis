abstract = {The results on the solar neutrino measurement covering over 7 years in the Kamiokande detector are explained, and their systematic errors are briefly reviewed. The time averaged flux assuming the shape of the 8B beta decay is (2.89−0.21+0.22 ±0.35) × 106cm2/sec and the ratio of the flux to the standard solar model of Bahcall and Pinsonnault is 0.51 ± 0.04 ± 0.06. Model independent approaches to the solar neutrino problem that we can conduct by the future solar neutrino experiment, Superkamiokande, are also presented.}

abstract = {The Mu3e experiment aims to find or exclude the lepton flavour violating decay µ → eee at branching fractions above 10 −16. A first phase of the experiment using an existing beamline at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) is designed to reach a single event sensitivity of 2 {\textperiodcentered} 10 −15. We present an overview of all aspects of the technical design and expected performance of the phase I Mu3e detector. The high rate of up to 10 8 muon decays per second and the low momenta of the decay electrons and positrons pose a unique set of challenges, which we tackle using an ultra thin tracking detector based on high-voltage monolithic active pixel sensors combined with scintillating fibres and tiles for precise timing measurements. Spokespersons: S. Ritt Kirk Arndt was a silicon detector development engineer. He came to Europe in 2014 after an illustrious career in the U.S. where he became known as "the best pair of hands in the silicon business". He built some remarkable silicon digital cameras for particle physics at the University of California Santa Barbara, Purdue University, and Oxford including one that glimpsed the Higgs particle for the first time at the LHC at CERN in 2012. These were the Silicon Micro-Vertex Detector for the CLEO II.V experiment at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring with UCSB, the CLEO III Silicon Vertex Detector and the CMS Phase 0 and Phase 1 Silicon Forward Pixel Detectors for the CMS experiment at the LHC at CERN with Purdue, and he was working on the ATLAS Upgrade Silicon Forward Pixel Detector at Oxford, the Mu3e tracker and detectors for photon science at the time of his death. For over a decade he also played an important role in the design of the 3.2 Gigapixel camera for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope both at Purdue and Oxford. Kirk was a very highly valued and widely appreciated colleague. He was always ready to help colleagues in the CLEO, CMS, LSST, ATLAS and Mu3e collaborations and many others in the international community who sought him out for advice. His positive can do attitude, exacting professional standards, dedication, willingness to nurture younger colleagues and his kindness are an example to us all. Shortly before his unexpected death at the age of 59, he hosted a Mu3e collaboration meeting in Oxford. It was a privilege to work with Kirk. He will live on in the hearts and minds of all that knew him.},

abstract = {We present a fast method for circular trajectory fitting. Our method is based on an explicit solution of an nonlinear least-squares problem to fit the circle curvature, direction and position parameters. The advantage with respect to previously published methods is that these parameters are Gaussian behaved which implies more reliable error estimation of the fitted parameters. We present formulae for error estimation as well as for propagation of parameters and error matrix to another point of reference.}

A first running phase using an existing beamline targets a single event sensitivity of 2 {\textperiodcentered} 10-15, while the ultimate sensitivity is reached in a second phase with a new high intensity muon beamline. Achieving such sensitivity requires a high muon rate along with a detector of large kinematic acceptance able to reconstruct the low momenta of the decay positrons and electrons with minimal material budget. The Mu3e experiment is mounted with ultra thin tracking detectors based on high-voltage monolithic active pixel sensors, combined with scintillating fibers and tiles for precise timing. This paper presents an overview of the experimental requirements, the technical design, and the construction readiness of Mu3e.},
